#How to run this program



##Before running the program

####Check the version of your JDK
Depending on your JDK version, the Java Swing library might
be different in terms of size in the GUI. We found out that;


> Version 17 works on a resolution of 2880x1800 and size of text 200%. 

This isn't a necessity, but it will give you the preferred size. 
The last to specifications can be found in windows under:
> âŠž &#8594; Win Settings &#8594; Display &#8594; Scale and Layout

##Add Maven to the project.
You need to have added _Maven_ to the project, otherwise
it won't work.
